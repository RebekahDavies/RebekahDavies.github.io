This will be my personal website/e-portfolio. It will contain a digital CV with my experiences and skills, and a blog. Inside this ReadMe file I will document the choices I made throughout the development process

Units of Measurement

Due to accessibility in browsers - it is best not to use px as it overides any font sizes set in the browser preferences. Instead I will use REMs for measurements and EMs for media queries as both pixels and REMs for media queries fail in various browsers when using browser zoom.
